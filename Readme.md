Spectrum server

## Development

Currently, Spectrum is in the early stages of development, which translates to significant instability. This instability primarily stems from the transition from the old development test codebase to the new Model-View-Controller based system.

### Note: Spectrum is in early development.
Please be aware that Spectrum is still in its early stages of development. While it already boasts powerful features, expect regular updates and improvements as we work towards a stable and feature-rich release.
